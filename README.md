## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Start Screen
User taps **Start** and begins the quiz flow.

### 2. Choose Difficulty
Users select a quiz level. Firestore determines which question set loads.

### 3. Question Flow
- Questions loaded from Firestore  
- ViewModel tracks selection, correctness, index, and score  
- Both single-answer and double-answer question types supported  

### 4. Loading Screen
`LoadingFragment` provides a smooth transition while data loads.

### 5. Results
- Final score shown  
- Feedback message displayed  
- Result saved to Firestore  

### 6. Quiz History
A RecyclerView lists:
- Score  
- Total questions  
- Date  
- Level

## 🗂️ Firebase Structure (example)

type: "single" | "double"

### History Collection
history/{userId}/[ results ]
score: int
